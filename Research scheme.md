Charges are continuously injected from electrodes to the bulk of samples and they may be captured by traps (both shallow traps and deep ones). When captured by deep traps, which means charges need to obtain higher energy to detrap, charge keep retention for a longer period. Also, during the migration from one electrode to another one, combination may occur when a positive charge encounters a negative one. Such a dynamic process includes entire charge motion  This model is used for calculating the charge transport property in the bulk of insulating material, including numerical calculation of space charge and electrical field distribution, energy gained by electrons as well as electrical strength. This model was once used for explaining the electrical breakdown behavior of polypropylene (PP, used for film of power capacitor) nanocomposite. By combining the experimental results and calculation of model, hidden electrical breakdown mechanism of PP nanocompositye was revealed. Details regarding the model can be seen in [Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated dc Electrical Breakdown of Polypropylene Nanocomposites][https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/11/1207/pdf].


Based on this model, we investigate the electrical breakdown property of PI samples with various thicknesses. It is found that similar mechanism modulates the breakdown behavior of PI and simulations results are better fit than the space charge electrical breakdown (SCEB) model. Relating results and comparison can be found in [Thickness-Dependent DC Electrical Breakdown of Polyimide Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement.][https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/9/1012/pdf]

**Dielectric property simulation of insulating material**

Method of modeling on dielectric property of aging Silicone Rubber is proposed. Specifically, by fitting the spectra to theoretical equations, we separated different polarization processes at various frequencies and calculated the values of corresponding parameters like thermal expansion coefficient, swelling ratio, etc.. By utilizing the correlations among various parameters, polarization property and specific process of SiR was delineated. Additionally, paper investigated the influence of degradation on the dielectric constant at high frequencies, ion concentration, conductivity and trap distribution, illustrating the charge transport property in the bulk of SiR and revealed the hidden cause for polarization.

## Summary of results ##

It is worth mentioning that, based on the summary of current  synthetise method of nanocomposite, the thesis employed a new fabrication method to prepare samples, which turns out that fillers homogeneously  dispersed and both stability and dielectric property were enhanced compared with former results that employed original method.  

The thesis correlate the characterization and testing results, namely morphology, thermal, crystallization property and polarization, trap distribution, electrical strength, conductivity property. After analyzing the correlations among different property of samples, it was concluded that trap distribution has a main effect on electrical breakdown property of PP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite. 

By comparing previous analysis and simulation results with the CTMD model, mechanism of PP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite has been revealed. It turns that nanofiller introduced interfacial regions to the neat material. Therefore, trap distribution in the bulk of material is altered, leading to the changes in distribution of space charge and electrical field distribution. Also, due to the occupation effect of charges in the traps, molecular motion may be impeded , leading to an increase in energy gained by electrons and spur of local current. Such a coordination process results the electrical breakdown property of nanocomposites. Results of thesis well explained the reasons for electrical breakdown property enhancement, which is significant for further study on modulating electrical strength even other electrical properties of nanocomposites.
