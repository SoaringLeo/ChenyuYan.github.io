## Education Background

I received BS degree with Electrical Engineering and Automation (GPA: 3.7, 10%) from [Northwestern Polytechnical University(NPU)](http://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/English/English/Home.htm), People Republic of China(PRC), in June 2016 and the topic of thesis is "Design of large scale Lithium-ion battery stack management system based on ARM". I received MS degree with Electrical Engineering (GPA: 3.7, 5%) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University(XJTU)](http://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/English_Version1/home.htm), PRC, in June 2019 and the topic of thesis is "Research on Electrical Breakdown Property of Polypropylene Nanocomposite Dielectric Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement". 

During postgraduate's study,  I was in Prof. [Shengtao Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shengtao_Li5)'s group and my  research focused on, power equipment, high voltage electric transmission  and charge transport modeling, numerical algorithm and calculation. In past 3 years, I have a relatively good understanding of high voltage transmission, energy storage, charge transport modeling, numerical algorithm and calculation for nanocomposite dielectric. Different from extensive researches regarding how to enhance electrical strength via doping and composing, I chose to investigate the internal mechanism and explain why methods like doping or composing has impact on electrical breakdown behavior of dielectrics. Under my prof. [Daomin Min](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daomin_Min)'s guidance, I gradually formulated ability to deal with academic research and got a deeper insight towards the electrical engineering. During this period, I was involved in 3 national projects and had 15 papers published.

##  Highlights of research

**Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated (CTMD) model**

This model considers the charge injection, migration, trapping/detrapping and recombination dynamic process and depicts the continuous motion process of charges in the bulk of dielectrics.

<img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/05/G1p9ghzKWNAemIj.png" alt="image-20200519225453984" style="zoom:80%;" />

<center> Fig. Scheme of CTMD model and molecular chain displacement model</center>
Charges are continuously injected from electrodes to the bulk of samples and they may be captured by traps (both shallow traps and deep ones). When captured by deep traps, which means charges need to obtain higher energy to detrap, charge keep retention for a longer period. Also, during the migration from one electrode to another one, combination may occur when a positive charge encounters a negative one. Such a dynamic process includes entire charge motion process.  By setting boundaries of model and solving Poisson's equation, this model can be used for calculating the charge transport property in the bulk of insulating material, including numerical calculation of space charge and electrical field distribution, energy gained by electrons as well as electrical strength. This model was once used for explaining the electrical breakdown behavior of polypropylene (PP, used for film of power capacitor) nanocomposite. By combining the experimental results and calculation of model, hidden electrical breakdown mechanism of PP nanocomposite was revealed. Details regarding the model can be seen in [Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated dc Electrical Breakdown of Polypropylene Nanocomposites](#).


Based on this model, we investigate the electrical breakdown property of PI samples with various thicknesses. It is found that similar mechanism modulates the breakdown behavior of PI and simulations results are better fit than the space charge electrical breakdown (SCEB) model. We also find similarity and differences of breakdown mechanism of various dielectric materials. Relating results and comparison can be found in [Thickness-Dependent DC Electrical Breakdown of Polyimide Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement.](#)

**Dielectric property simulation of insulating material**

Method of modeling on dielectric property of aging Silicone Rubber is proposed. Specifically, by fitting the spectra to theoretical equations, we separated different polarization processes at various frequencies and calculated the values of corresponding parameters like thermal expansion coefficient, swelling ratio, etc.. By utilizing the correlations among various parameters, polarization property and specific process of SiR was delineated. Additionally, paper investigated the influence of degradation on the dielectric constant at high frequencies, ion concentration, conductivity and trap distribution, illustrating the charge transport property in the bulk of SiR and revealed the hidden cause for polarization.

## Thesis paper

Title of my thesis paper is  "Research on Electrical Breakdown Property of Polypropylene Nanocomposite Dielectric Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement". By combining the experimental results and modeling calculation results, the thesis proposes an explanation for demonstrating the mechanism of electrical breakdown property of PP/Al~2~O~3~ nanocomposite. 

### Overview on structure

Entire research of thesis includes sample fabrication, characterization and testing as well as modeling and analysis, shown as the graph below.

### Summary of results

It is worth mentioning that, based on the summary of current  synthetise method of nanocomposite, the thesis employed a new fabrication method to prepare samples, which turns out that fillers homogeneously  dispersed and both stability and dielectric property were enhanced compared with former results that employed original method.  

The thesis correlates the characterization and testing results, namely morphology, thermal, crystallization property and polarization, trap distribution, electrical strength, conductivity property. After analyzing the correlations among different property of samples, it was concluded that trap distribution has a main effect on electrical breakdown property of PP/Al~2~O~3~ nanocomposite. 

By comparing previous analysis and simulation results with the CTMD model, mechanism of PP/Al~2~O~3~ nanocomposite has been revealed. It turns that nanofiller introduced interfacial regions to the neat material. Therefore, trap distribution in the bulk of material is altered, leading to the changes in distribution of space charge and electrical field distribution. Also, due to the occupation effect of charges in the traps, molecular motion may be impeded , leading to an increase in energy gained by electrons and spur of local current. Such a coordination process results the electrical breakdown property of nanocomposites. Results of thesis well explained the reasons for electrical breakdown property enhancement, which is significant for further study on modulating electrical strength even other electrical properties of nanocomposites.

<center>  <img src="img/973.jpg" height="130" width="180;" div align = "center"/>  </center>

This project investigated the coupling impact of space charge accumulation, transient arc micro particle bombardment, metal particle deposition on the falshover property of fractrue insulating system in the process of dc arc switching, and revealed its influence regularity and failure mechanism. Based on nanocomposition modification tech, study figured out the the methods to suppress the space charge accumulation and metal particle deposition in the fracture insulating system and proposed approaches to resist flashover damage and aging. This research provided the theoretical and technology support for enhancing the voltage, current as well as lifespan of circuit breaker. I was mainly involved in the modeling of energy accumulation and flashover process, and investigated the influence of charge transport parameters and temperature on flashover behavior.

- **Charge transport property in silicone rubber under harmonic aging (Project of China Electric Power Research Institute)** 

This project was originated from the need that power equipment like cable and bush are easier to be aged under the high-order harmonics, which hence deteriorated the performance of power system. The study, taking the silicon rubber from the outer coat of cable terminals and the insulating oil paper in the bush as the research objects, quantificationally manifested the aging status and summarized the insulating material deterioration regularity. In addition, aging model for cable and bush were proposed to predict their odd lifespans and the mechanism of aging have been demonstrated. I was responsible for experiment design, experiment accomplishment, modeling calculation and paper writing.

## Work Experience and Internship ## 

**State Grid Corporation of China   Department of Information and Internet	2019.09 - Now** 

<center><img src="img/SGCC.jpg" height="150" width="240;" div align = "center"/></center>

I worked in State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), known as the largest corporation in China, for half a year. In this period, I worked as a member in Department of Information and Internet, which focuses on data collection and processing to propose practical suggestions for the development of corporation. I have been involved in a project to predict short-term load of grid power, including day load forecast and workload forecast. This work aimed at suppressing illegal electric larceny especially in corporation with relatively higher demand for electric resources, so that the lost profits can be reclaimed and SGCC also has a greater power to better distribute the power transmission. In this project, I was responsible for forecast modeling and data processing, which provided the basis of prediction. Specifically, with the previous data of electric usage as the input, we built up architecture based on  RNN and LSTM model to forecast the electric demand for following 7 days. By comparing with realistic values, it was proved that model had a relatively high precision and value of MAPE was around 2.4%. This project has been recognized as one of the most important projects for 2019-2020. In addition, we are currently focusing on the build of central data platform, which can help to fully utilize numerous data resources to run the company more efficiently and yield more profits, for instance, data generated by routine experiment and maintenance of power equipments, data monitoring of charging expenditure (wave crest and peak) and status of device parameter including insulating oil temperature, switch motion, harmonic wave, etc. are also collected to formulate dynamic process.

<center><img src="img\ABB.png" height="120" width="200" div align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" /></center>

I was a internship of technology department in ABB for four months. During this period, I have the initial understanding of industrialization of power system, especially the power capacitor. With an increase in familiarity with equipment, I have a more lucid concept for structure of power system and commercial market in this field. Plus, with the support of investigation in the equipment workshop, I learned the processing flow of capacitor, starting from the polypropylene film fabrication to the component assembly. In addition, I also got an opportunity to be engaged in the technical discussion with foreign experts, which largely bring inspiration to my further exploration on the research. Through intensive discussion, I found that increasing demand for high voltage transmission had been an urgent need for the grids in China, property of electric breakdown, however, was a key factor that determined the performance of power capacity. Therefore, when choosing the major field in my master phase, I forwardly approached to my professor and expressed my plan on the research of breakdown property of polypropylene. One more thing, it is worth being mentioned that I developed a program based on C++ during my internship to help collecting documents to meet the needs of engineers, which has been integrated to the system of ABB and used until now.

## Personal Statement

I have a good mathematical modeling and programming basis for developing scholar research. I have ever participated Mathematical Contest in Modeling and obtained international/national award for 7 times, such an experience gave me the basic understanding of modeling. When facing with following modeling and calculation work, like charge transport modeling and lifespan prediction, I can better handle it and tried to proposed new methods to solve problems. Also, I can employ Python, SPSS, MATLAB to support my research work, charge transport model proposed in my published work is compiled by MATLAB. Plus, I'm enrolling in the study of machine learning and data science in Coursera to have a systematic study and make preparation for following work.

I have an positive attitude towards scholar research and good ability to achieve goals, which are important quality for a Ph.D candidate. I intend to do research work in future (either industrial or academic), since I find it so interesting to solve out the puzzlement and propel the implementation of my research field, such a sense of achievement is hard to get via other ways. Furthermore, I have a relatively good knowledge accumulation of my research field, including experiment design, data processing and paper writing, which guarantees my promising yields on the way of achieving Ph.D. I can well cooperate with mates and professors. In my perspective, relationship between professor and students is not dedication and obey, but discussion and mutual inspiration.  Specifically, I need to regularly discuss my ideas on research with professor and seek for more novel ideas, however, I should have a lucid scheme for my work rather than relying on professor's order. Actually, I did well in past three years, like I always make full preparation prior to discussing with my professor on some key problems to enhance our communication efficiency and I also proposed my own ideas on some cardinal points. After discussion, I immediately conclude results and try to modify or consummate my research methods.

In addition, I am a good learner for new challenges and I like to combine theoretical analysis with practical application. It is inevitable that numerous unexpected problems can arouse during study and academic research, as far as I'm concerned, I enjoy solving problems and obtained new skills. For instance, when I started to participate in MCM, I got familiar with new models every time when facing new questions. Also, it is my initial experience for numerical calculation, like Genetic Algorithm, greedy algorithm, Dynamic Programming, etc., and formal paper writing, like structure, format, details and demonstration skills, which really paves the way for my following research. I firmly believe that I can do more and better once I decide to make it.
