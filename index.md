##  Highlights of research

**Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated (CTMD) model**

This model considers the charge injection, migration, trapping/detrapping and recombination  as a dynamic process and depicts the continuous motion process of charges in the bulk of dielectrics.

<img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/05/G1p9ghzKWNAemIj.png" alt="image-20200519225453984" style="zoom:80%;" />

<center> Fig. Scheme of CTMD model and molecular chain displacement model</center>
Charges are continuously injected from electrodes to the bulk of samples, and they may be captured by traps (both shallow traps and deep ones). When captured by deep traps, charges need to obtain higher energy to detrap and retain a more extended period. Also, during the migration from one electrode to another, a combination may occur when a positive charge encounters a negative one. Such a dynamic process includes the entire charge motion process. By setting boundaries of the model and solving Poisson's equation, this model can be used for calculating the charge transport property in the bulk of insulating material, including numerical calculation of space charge and electric field distribution, energy gained by electrons as well, as electrical strength. This model was once used for explaining the electrical breakdown behavior of polypropylene (PP, used for the film of power capacitor) nanocomposite. By combining the experimental results and calculation of the model, the hidden electrical breakdown mechanism of PP nanocomposite was revealed. Details regarding the model can be found in [Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated dc Electrical Breakdown of Polypropylene Nanocomposites](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/11/1207/pdf).

Based on this model, we investigate the electrical breakdown property of PI samples with various thicknesses. It is found that a similar mechanism modulates the breakdown behavior of PI and simulation better fits than the space charge electrical breakdown (SCEB) model. We also find similarities and differences in the breakdown mechanism of various dielectric materials. Relating results and comparison can be found in [Thickness-Dependent DC Electrical Breakdown of Polyimide Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement.](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/9/1012/pdf)

This model can further be applied to the charge transport in other systems, not limiting to insulation material system since regularity of charge behavior exists in any system with the external electric field applied. Currently, in our research group, this model is also modified and utilized in the area of ultra-high thermal conductivity and carrier migration in the reliable battery. In the future, it is promising to combine this model of machine learning to determine a more accurate probability of charge behavior so that it can more closely reveal the charge migration property in the system. Also, the dimension of charge transport can be extended to 3D to show a tridimensional picture of its motion property.

**Dielectric property simulation of insulating dielectrics**

Method of modeling on dielectric property of aging Silicone Rubber is proposed. Specifically, by fitting the spectra to theoretical equations, we separated different polarization processes at various frequencies and calculated the values of corresponding parameters like thermal expansion coefficient, swelling ratio, etc. By utilizing the correlations among multiple parameters, polarization property, and specific process of SiR was delineated. Additionally, the paper investigated the influence of degradation on the dielectric constant at high frequencies, ion concentration, conductivity, and trap distribution, illustrating the charge transport property in the bulk of SiR and revealed the hidden cause for polarization. More information can be seen in [Dielectric and Carrier Transport Properties of Silicone Rubber Degraded by Gamma Irradiation](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/9/10/533/pdf)

**Machine learning for grid load forecast**

In actual commercial marketing, suppressing illegal electric stealing, especially in corporations with relatively higher demand for electric resources, is essential for the profits of power corporations. In this project, I was responsible for forecast modeling and data processing, which provided the basis of prediction. Specifically, with the previous electric usage data as the input, the model was based on RNN and LSTM model to forecast the electric demand for the following days. By comparing with realistic values, it was proved that the model had relatively high precision, and the amount of MAPE was around 2.4%. Corresponding results and data have been collected to apply for a national project in SGCC.

**Central big data platform and smart grid**

We built a central platform, collaborating with Alibaba, to collect all data from power grid system to help making decision regarding equipment maintenance, power distribution and redistribution, dispatching and monitoring. For example, a serious problem of vehicle charging is occupation of space, which means some customers complete charging with vehicles immobile, aggravating the limited usage originated from insufficient charging piles. In this regard, we optimize the power supply of electricity power and get customer notified when the charging finished to make full use of charging piles and guarantee most customers can utilize devices. Another scenario is the maintenance of power equipment. By monitoring the dynamic change of transformer oil temperature, dielectric loss, capacity of capacitors, and other indexes, engineers can keep a systematic observation of power equipment. Meanwhile, they can forecast equipment performance in the long run and arrange a routine maintenance plan, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of electrical tests and repairing.

<center><img src="img/NSFC.jpg" height="160" width="190;" div align = "center"/><center>
This project originated from the need for enhancing the breakdown property of polyethylene to meet up with its demand for high voltage power transmission. This study investigated molecular motion property in the interfacial regions and its impact on dc breakdown property of polyethylene nanocomposites. Also, it further explained the microscopic process of electrical breakdown. I'm responsible for experiment progress and paper writing (academic paper and project report).

<center>  <img src="img/973.jpg" height="130" width="180;" div align = "center"/>  </center>

This project investigated the coupling impact of space charge accumulation, transient arc microparticle bombardment, metal particle deposition on the flashover property of fracture insulating system in the process of dc arc switching, and revealed its influence regularity and failure mechanism. The study figured out the methods to suppress the space charge accumulation and metal particle deposition in the fracture insulating system and proposed approaches to resist flashover damage and aging based on nanocomposite modification tech. This research provided the theoretical and technological support for enhancing the circuit breaker's voltage, current, and lifespan. I was mainly involved in modeling energy accumulation and flashover processes and investigated the influence of charge transport parameters and temperature on flashover behavior.

- **Charge transport property in silicone rubber under harmonic aging (Project of China Electric Power Research Institute)** 

This project originated from the need for power equipment like cable and bush to deteriorate under the high-order harmonics, which hence declined the performance of the power system. The study, taking the silicon rubber from the outer coat of cable terminals and the insulating oil paper in the bush as the research objects, quantificationally manifested the aging status and summarized the insulating material deterioration regularity. Besides, the aging model was proposed to predict the lifespans of cable and bush. At the same time, the electrical breakdown process can be well uncovered and lucidly demonstrated. I was responsible for experiment design, experiment accomplishment, modeling calculation, and paper writing.

## Work Experience and Internship ## 

**State Grid Corporation of China   Department of Information and Internet	2019.08 - 2020.09** 

<center><img src="img/SGCC.jpg" height="150" width="240;" div align = "center"/></center>

I worked in the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), the largest national corporation, for one year. In this period, I worked as a member of the Department of Information and Internet, which focuses on data collection and processing to propose practical suggestions for the corporation's development. I have participated in a project to predict the short-term load of grid power, including day load forecast and workload forecast. In actual commercial marketing, suppressing illegal electric stealing, especially in corporations with relatively higher demand for electric resources, is essential for the profits of power corporations. In this project, I was responsible for forecast modeling and data processing, which provided the basis of prediction. Specifically, with the previous electric usage data as the input, the model was based on RNN and LSTM model to forecast the electric demand for the following days. By comparing with realistic values, it was proved that the model had relatively high precision, and the amount of MAPE was around 2.4%.

**Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., China      Electrical Engineer Internship        2016.05-2016.09** 

<center><img src="img\ABB.png" height="120" width="200" div align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" /></center>

I was an internship in the technology department in ABB for four months. During this period, I understood the industrialization of the power system, especially the power capacitor. With an increase in familiarity with equipment, I have a more lucid concept of the power system structure and commercial market in this field. Plus, with the support of investigation in the equipment workshop, I learned the capacitor's processing flow, starting from the polypropylene film fabrication to the component assembly. Additionally, I also got an opportunity to be engaged in the technical discussion with foreign experts, which primarily inspires my further exploration of the research. Through the intensive seminar, I found that increasing demand for high voltage transmission had been an urgent need for grids in China. However, the property of electric breakdown was a critical factor that determined the performance of power capacity. Therefore, when choosing the research field in my master phase, I approached my professor and expressed my plan for the research of the breakdown property of polypropylene. One more thing, it is worth mentioning that I developed a program based on C++ during my internship to help collect documents to meet the needs of engineers, which has been integrated into the system of ABB and used until now.

## Skill Highlight

1. **Good modeling and calculation ability**

   Not only in charge transport modeling and material modeling, but I can also fluently use MATLAB, SPSS, Python, and TensorFlow to subordinate academic work.

2. **Proficient in electronics and material science**

   Familiar with the electronic device and material fabrication, characterization, and testing methods, also capable of offering theoretical analysis due to a relatively solid foundation of physics and chemistry.

3. **Excellent ability of data processing**

   A study of experimental results and data processing can be well conducted due to a combination of experiment analysis (relying on a clear understanding of experimental principle and mechanism). This ability also guarantees quick adaptability and improves research efficiency when facing new practical projects. 

## Personal Statement

I have excellent mathematical modeling and programming bases for developing scholarly research. I have ever participated in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling and obtained international/national awards seven times. Such an experience gave me a basic understanding of modeling. When facing the following modeling and calculation work, like charge transport modeling and lifespan prediction, I can better handle it and try to propose new methods to solve problems. Also, I can employ Python, SPSS, MATLAB, etc., to support my research work. The charge transport model presented in my published work is compiled by MATLAB. Plus, I'm enrolling in machine learning and data science study at Gatech to have a systematic review and prepare for the following work.

I have a positive attitude towards scholarly research and an excellent ability to achieve goals, which are essential qualities for a Ph.D. candidate. I intend to do research work in the future (either industrial or academic) since I find it so interesting to solve the puzzlement and propel my research field's implementation. Such a sense of achievement is hard to get in other ways. Furthermore, I have a relatively good knowledge accumulation of my research field, including experiment design, data processing, and paper writing, which guarantees my good yields on the way of achieving a Ph.D. I can smoothly cooperate with mates and professors. In my perspective, the relationship between professor and students is not dedication and obey, but discussion and mutual inspiration. Specifically, I need to regularly discuss my research ideas with the professor and seek more novel ideas. However, I should have a lucid scheme for my work rather than relying on the professor's order. I did well in the past three years. For instance, I always make full preparation before discussing some cardinal problems with my professor to enhance our communication efficiency, and I also proposed my ideas on some vital points. After discussion, I immediately conclude results and try to modify or consummate my research methods.

Finally, I am a good learner for new challenges, and I like to combine theoretical analysis with practical application. Numerous unexpected problems can inevitably arise during the study and academic research. I enjoy solving problems and obtain new skills. For instance, when I started to participate in MCM, I became familiar with new models whenever I faced further questions. Also, it is my initial experience for numerical calculation, like the Genetic Algorithm, greedy algorithm, Dynamic Programming, etc., and formal paper writing, like structure, format, details, and demonstration skills, which paves the way for my following research. I firmly believe that I can do more and better once I decide to make it.
