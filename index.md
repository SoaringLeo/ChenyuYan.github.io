##  Highlights of research

**Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated (CTMD) model**

This model considers the charge injection, migration, trapping/detrapping and recombination dynamic process and depicts the continuous motion process of charges in the bulk of dielectrics.

<img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/05/G1p9ghzKWNAemIj.png" alt="image-20200519225453984" style="zoom:80%;" />

<center> Fig. Scheme of CTMD model and molecular chain displacement model</center>
Charges are continuously injected from electrodes to the bulk of samples and they may be captured by traps (both shallow traps and deep ones). When captured by deep traps, which means charges need to obtain higher energy to detrap, charge keep retention for a longer period. Also, during the migration from one electrode to another one, combination may occur when a positive charge encounters a negative one. Such a dynamic process includes entire charge motion process.  By setting boundaries of model and solving Poisson's equation, this model can be used for calculating the charge transport property in the bulk of insulating material, including numerical calculation of space charge and electrical field distribution, energy gained by electrons as well as electrical strength. This model was once used for explaining the electrical breakdown behavior of polypropylene (PP, used for film of power capacitor) nanocomposite. By combining the experimental results and calculation of model, hidden electrical breakdown mechanism of PP nanocomposite was revealed. Details regarding the model can be seen in [Carrier Transport and Molecular Displacement Modulated dc Electrical Breakdown of Polypropylene Nanocomposites](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/11/1207/pdf).

Based on this model, we investigate the electrical breakdown property of PI samples with various thicknesses. It is found that similar mechanism modulates the breakdown behavior of PI and simulations results are better fit than the space charge electrical breakdown (SCEB) model. We also find similarity and differences of breakdown mechanism of various dielectric materials. Relating results and comparison can be found in [Thickness-Dependent DC Electrical Breakdown of Polyimide Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement.](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/9/1012/pdf)

This model can further be applied to the charge transport in other systems, not limiting to insulation material system, since regularity of charge behavior exists in any system with external electrical field applied. Currently, in our research group, this model is also modified and utilized in field of ultra high thermal conductivity and carrier migration in solid battery. In the future, it is promising to combine this model of machine learning to determine more accurate probability of charge behavior so that it can more closely reveal the charge migration property in the system, Also, the dimension of charge transport can be extended to 3D to show a tridimensional picture of its motion property.

**Dielectric property simulation of insulating dielectrics**

Method of modeling on dielectric property of aging Silicone Rubber is proposed. Specifically, by fitting the spectra to theoretical equations, we separated different polarization processes at various frequencies and calculated the values of corresponding parameters like thermal expansion coefficient, swelling ratio, etc.. By utilizing the correlations among various parameters, polarization property and specific process of SiR was delineated. Additionally, paper investigated the influence of degradation on the dielectric constant at high frequencies, ion concentration, conductivity and trap distribution, illustrating the charge transport property in the bulk of SiR and revealed the hidden cause for polarization. More information can be seen in [Dielectric and Carrier Transport Properties of Silicone Rubber Degraded by Gamma Irradiation](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/9/10/533/pdf)

**Machine learning for grid load forecast**

In actual commercial marketing, suppressing illegal electric larceny especially in corporation with relatively higher demand for electric resources, so that the lost profits can be reclaimed and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), the largest national power grid corporation in China, also has a greater power to better distribute the power transmission. In this project, I was responsible for forecast modeling and data processing, which provided the basis of prediction. Specifically, with the previous data of electric usage as the input, model was based on RNN and LSTM model to forecast the electric demand for following 7 days. By comparing with realistic values, it was proved that model had a relatively high precision and value of MAPE was around 2.4%. Corresponding results and data haven been collected to apply for a national project in SGCC.

**Central big data platform and smart grid**

we built a central platform, collaborating with Alibaba, to collect all data from power grid system to help making decision regarding equipment maintenance, power distribution and redistribution, dispatching and monitoring. For example, a serious problem of vehicle charging is occupation of space, which means some customers complete charging with vehicles immobile, aggravating the limited usage originated from insufficient charging piles. In this regard, we optimize the power supply of electricity power and get customer notified when the charging if finished to make full use of charging piles and guarantee most customers can utilize devices. Another scenario is maintenance of power equipment, by monitoring dynamic change of transformer oil temperature, dielectric loss and capacity of capacitors and other indexes to keep a systematic observation of power equipment, meanwhile forecasting the performance of equipment in a long run and arrange routine maintenance plan, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of electrical test and repairing.

<center><img src="img/SGCC.jpg" height="150" width="240;" div align = "center"/></center>

I worked in State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), known as the largest national corporation, for one year. In this period, I worked as a member in Department of Information and Internet, which focuses on data collection and processing to propose practical suggestions for the development of corporation. I have been involved in a project to predict short-term load of grid power, including day load forecast and workload forecast. This work aimed at suppressing illegal electric larceny especially in corporation with relatively higher demand for electric resources, so that the lost profits can be reclaimed and SGCC also has a greater power to better distribute the power transmission. In this project, I was responsible for forecast modeling and data processing, which provided the basis of prediction. Specifically, with the previous data of electric usage as the input, we built up architecture based on  RNN and LSTM model to forecast the electric demand for following 7 days. By comparing with realistic values, it was proved that model had a relatively high precision and value of MAPE was around 2.4%. 

Also, we built a central platform, collaborating with Alibaba, to collect all data from power grid system to help making decision regarding equipment maintenance, power distribution and redistribution, dispatching and monitoring. For example, a serious problem of vehicle charging is occupation of space, which means some customers complete charging with vehicles immobile, aggravating the limited usage originated from insufficient charging piles. In this regard, we optimize the power supply of electricity power and get customer notified when the charging if finished to make full use of charging piles and guarantee most customers can utilize devices. Also, data generated by routine experiment and maintenance of power equipments, data monitoring of charging expenditure (wave crest and peak) and status of device parameter including insulating oil temperature, switch motion, harmonic wave, etc. are also collected to formulate dynamic process, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of electrical test and repairing.

**Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., China      Electrical Engineer Internship        2016.05-2016.09** 

<center><img src="img\ABB.png" height="120" width="200" div align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" /></center>

I was a internship of technology department in ABB for four months. During this period, I have the initial understanding of industrialization of power system, especially the power capacitor. With an increase in familiarity with equipment, I have a more lucid concept for structure of power system and commercial market in this field. Plus, with the support of investigation in the equipment workshop, I learned the processing flow of capacitor, starting from the polypropylene film fabrication to the component assembly. In addition, I also got an opportunity to be engaged in the technical discussion with foreign experts, which largely bring inspiration to my further exploration on the research. Through intensive discussion, I found that increasing demand for high voltage transmission had been an urgent need for the grids in China, property of electric breakdown, however, was a key factor that determined the performance of power capacity. Therefore, when choosing the major field in my master phase, I forwardly approached to my professor and expressed my plan on the research of breakdown property of polypropylene. One more thing, it is worth being mentioned that I developed a program based on C++ during my internship to help collecting documents to meet the needs of engineers, which has been integrated to the system of ABB and used until now.

## Personal Statement

I have a good mathematical modeling and programming basis for developing scholar research. I have ever participated Mathematical Contest in Modeling and obtained international/national award for 7 times, such an experience gave me the basic understanding of modeling. When facing with following modeling and calculation work, like charge transport modeling and lifespan prediction, I can better handle it and tried to proposed new methods to solve problems. Also, I can employ Python, SPSS, MATLAB to support my research work, charge transport model proposed in my published work is compiled by MATLAB. Plus, I'm enrolling in the study of machine learning and data science in Coursera to have a systematic study and make preparation for following work.

I have an positive attitude towards scholar research and good ability to achieve goals, which are important quality for a Ph.D candidate. I intend to do research work in future (either industrial or academic), since I find it so interesting to solve out the puzzlement and propel the implementation of my research field, such a sense of achievement is hard to get via other ways. Furthermore, I have a relatively good knowledge accumulation of my research field, including experiment design, data processing and paper writing, which guarantees my promising yields on the way of achieving Ph.D. I can well cooperate with mates and professors. In my perspective, relationship between professor and students is not dedication and obey, but discussion and mutual inspiration.  Specifically, I need to regularly discuss my ideas on research with professor and seek for more novel ideas, however, I should have a lucid scheme for my work rather than relying on professor's order. Actually, I did well in past three years, like I always make full preparation prior to discussing with my professor on some key problems to enhance our communication efficiency and I also proposed my own ideas on some cardinal points. After discussion, I immediately conclude results and try to modify or consummate my research methods.

In addition, I am a good learner for new challenges and I like to combine theoretical analysis with practical application. It is inevitable that numerous unexpected problems can arouse during study and academic research, as far as I'm concerned, I enjoy solving problems and obtained new skills. For instance, when I started to participate in MCM, I got familiar with new models every time when facing new questions. Also, it is my initial experience for numerical calculation, like Genetic Algorithm, greedy algorithm, Dynamic Programming, etc., and formal paper writing, like structure, format, details and demonstration skills, which really paves the way for my following research. I firmly believe that I can do more and better once I decide to make it.
